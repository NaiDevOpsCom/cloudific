Project Overview
The SecureCloud Monitor project aims to enhance the security and monitoring capabilities of a cloud infrastructure on AWS, specifically addressing the need for an integrated solution that utilizes AWS-native services for a cost-effective, scalable, and robust observability framework. This initiative follows a recent DDoS attack that caused significant downtime, underlining the need for improved resilience and threat management.

Project Objectives
Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems: Utilize AWS CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray for comprehensive monitoring and observability.
Enhance security measures: Integrate AWS WAF and AWS Shield for improved security posture against DDoS and other attacks.
Infrastructure as Code: Use Terraform for provisioning and managing AWS resources.
CI/CD Integration: Establish pipelines for continuous integration and deployment using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.
Version Control: Manage and store all infrastructure code on GitHub.
Architectural Strategy
1. AWS Core Services Utilization
Amazon VPC: Foundation of the cloud environment ensuring isolated network architecture.
Amazon ECS: Container management service to run and scale application deployments securely.
2. Security Components
AWS WAF and AWS Shield: Protect the application from web exploits and DDoS attacks.
IAM Roles and Policies: Ensure minimal access necessary for operations to enhance security.
3. Monitoring and Logging
AWS CloudWatch: Monitor resources and applications, capturing logs and metrics.
AWS X-Ray: Analyze and debug production, providing insights into the architecture's performance and operations.
4. CI/CD and DevOps Tools
AWS CodePipeline: Automate the release processes, enabling fast and reliable application updates.
AWS CodeBuild: Compile source code, run tests, and produce ready-to-deploy software packages.
5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform: Provision and manage AWS resources as code, enhancing the consistency and reproducibility of the infrastructure.
Detailed Component Analysis
Networking and Security
VPC Configuration: Define subnets, route tables, and gateways to control network traffic flow securely.
Security Groups and NACLs: Deploy stateful and stateless traffic control to safeguard inbound and outbound interactions.
Containerization and Orchestration
ECS Task Definitions: Specify the containers and volume configuration.
ECS Services: Manage the long-running instances of application containers.
Identity and Access Management
IAM Roles: Specific roles for ECS tasks, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to interact securely with other AWS services.
Deployment Strategy
Blue/Green Deployment: Minimize downtime and risk by ensuring that the new version is up and running before switching traffic.

Documentation and Version Control
Documentation: Detailed documentation of the architecture, settings, and operational procedures.
Version Control: Use GitHub for source code management and version control, ensuring that changes are tracked and managed effectively.
Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Threat Identification: Regularly update threat models to reflect potential security risks.
Security Audits: Periodic reviews and audits to ensure compliance with security standards and best practices.
