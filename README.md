[Monitoring & Security ]
Regarding the Previous Architecture On May 31, 2024, the backend experienced a 3-hour downtime due to unresponsiveness, which impacted the business. After further investigation, it was determined that the issue was caused by a DDoS attack (IP flooding) on the backend ECS service . The client requires a robust monitoring and alerting system with built-in security features such as a firewall and authentication, without relying on third-party monitoring/security tools due to budget constraints. As a DevOps/Cloud/Solutions specialist, how would you create an observability solution with security measures in place within the infrastructure to meet their objectives? Please ensure the following points are addressed:

Timeline: 1 week (flexible if necessary, but aim to complete within the estimated time)
*[IMPORTANT]* Architecture Diagram: A detailed architecture diagram is crucial.
*[IMPORTANT]* Proposed Solutions: Clearly state the solutions and explain why they are effective. Outline the changes that will enhance monitoring and security within the infrastructure. *[IMPORTANT]* Threat Mapping Diagram: Provide a threat mapping diagram in the architecture.
*[GOOD TO HAVE]* Infrastructure as Code: Use infrastructure as code to create AWS resources.
*[GOOD TO HAVE]* CI/CD Integration: Implement CI/CD pipelines to deploy resources.
*[IMPORTANT]* Version Control: Store the code in GitHub or any other version control system.
*[GOOD TO HAVE]* Network Flow Diagram: Include a network flow diagram.
